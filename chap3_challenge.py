#Challenge Set for Chapter 3

# 1. Print 3 different strings
print('Dana is printing Strings.')
print('The strings are not very creative.')
print('why even do these challenges.')

# 2. Wirte program that prints a message if variable is less than 10, and different message if variable  greater than or equal to 10.
x=5
if x < 10:
    print('This is one low x.')
else:
    print('X is not as low as I would have thought.')


# 3. Write program that prints a message if variable is less than or equal to 10,
# another message if greater than 10 but less than or equal to 25,
# and another message if the variable is greater than 25.
if x <= 10:
    print('get low')
elif 10 < x <= 25:
    print('get a little higher now')
elif x > 25:
    print('raise it on up.')


# 4. Create a program that divides two variables and prints the remainder.
y=2
print(x % y)

# 5.Create program that divides two variables and prints quotient
print(x//y)

# 6. Write program with age assigned to integer,
# that prints out different strings depending on what integer is.
age = 50
if age >= 55:
    print('you''s getting old')
else:
    print('you''ve got some life in you yet.')
